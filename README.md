# C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Revision Guide

## üìù Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive C++ project designed for Object-Oriented Programming revision. The project consolidates all major OOP concepts into practical, easy-to-understand examples within a single file, making it perfect for students and developers looking to review or learn OOP principles.

## üéØ Purpose

- **Educational Resource**: Serves as a quick reference guide for C++ OOP concepts
- **Revision Material**: Perfect for exam preparation and interview practice  
- **Practical Examples**: Each concept is demonstrated with real-world applicable code
- **All-in-One**: Everything you need to know about C++ OOP in one comprehensive file

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **Compiler**: Compatible with GCC, Clang, MSVC
- **Standard**: C++11 and above

## üìö Topics Covered

### Core OOP Concepts
- **Classes and Objects** - Basic structure and instantiation
- **Encapsulation** - Data hiding and access control
- **Inheritance** - Single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance
- **Polymorphism** - Function overloading, operator overloading, virtual functions
- **Abstraction** - Abstract classes and pure virtual functions

### Advanced Topics
- **Constructors and Destructors** - Default, parameterized, copy constructors
- **Friend Functions and Classes** - Access to private members
- **Static Members** - Static variables and functions
- **Virtual Functions** - Runtime polymorphism and dynamic binding
- **Templates** - Function and class templates
- **Exception Handling** - Try, catch, and throw mechanisms
- **File Handling** - Stream classes and file operations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio)
- Basic understanding of C++ syntax
